<h1>Instructions</h1>
We have submitted a repository link and the website link. You just have to either simply click on the website link that we have provided or clone the repository and run npm i followed by npm run dev in the terminal and you will land on MeetBuddy. 
<br></br>
<h1>Overview</h1>
MeetBuddy is an application that is providing you with lag-free, jitter-free online meetings. You won't be missing any part of the meeting even if you have joined the meeting a bit late because the entire meeting will be transcripted.
<br></br>
<h1>Inspiration</h1>
Has it ever happened that you went to attend a meeting but you are a bit late and you realize that the part you missed was the most important part of the meeting? At that moment you regret a lot. The inspiration for building this app comes from these moments only. Sometimes it happens that you are not able to attend meetings/classes on time due to any personal/emergency/circumstantial situation. At such times you just want someone to give you a brief description of what happened.
<br></br>
<h1>What It Does?</h1>
Our motto behind this app is to make online meetings more contextual and reliable. What it does is allows you to gain the information that you thought you may have lost the chance to gain.
The user has to sign up through google. Then the user can create/join a room and invite others to that particular room. If you due to some reason join the meeting a bit late, you don't have to worry at all because the meeting would be transcripted and you will not miss anything from that meeting. 
<!-- There are some other features that you can use during the meeting such as white board, screen sharing etc. -->

<h1>How We Built It?</h1>
First of all, we planned out the idea, its detailed features and made a flowchart to prevent any kind of technical errors in the end. We did all of this on a sheet of paper listing the logic flows and how to make the system more optimized. At last, we came up with an implementation plan.

All four of us having experience in frontend (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ReactJs/NextJs) and backend(Firebase), we decided to assign equal amounts of frontend and backend work to each member.

<h1>Challenges We Ran Into</h1>
Major challenges were using new libraries for scanning Store QR Codes and Item Barcodes. We used two different libraries namely react-qr-reader and QuaggaJS which track QRs and barcodes in real-time respectively. Another major challenge was handling multiple data at the same time. Another major challenge was sleep deprivation as we later realized that the app we're trying to build is not a simple one with basic features.
<br></br>
<h1>Accomplishments That We Are Proud Of</h1>
Accomplishments we're proud of are successfully implementing the logic flow we had decided at the beginning of the hackathon and that too is upto our expectations. We're also proud of the web application that we were able to build with libraries which we had never heard of during the hackathon itself as we learned a lot while implementing them.
<br></br>
<h1>What We Learned?</h1>
As already mentioned above, we learned a lot while implementing some libraries we have never used before. We majorly learned how to collaborate and manage time in these kinds of hackathons.
